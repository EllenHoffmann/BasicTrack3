#Satz des Pythagoras: a^2 + b^2 = c^2

a = float(input("What is the length of the first side of the triangle in cm?"))
b = float(input("What is the length of the second side of the triangle in cm?"))
c = float(input("What is the length of the third side of the triangle in cm?"))


print((a**0.5 + b**0.5) == c**0.5)
